# OBS Countdown

![Countdown Preview](dev/countdown.gif)

## **Countdown has been mostly discontinued as OBS has this feature built in as a plugin in [v21](https://github.com/jp9000/obs-studio/releases/tag/21.0.0)**

## Using the Countdown:

1. Download the `countdown.html` file
2. Open the file in Chrome, Firefox, etc. (*Internet Explorer will **NOT** work*)
3. Fill out the form to your liking
4. Press the `Generate Countdown URL` button at the bottom
5. Paste the text that appears into OBS/XSplit's BrowserSource (Make sure the **ENTIRE URL** is pasted
   - If you are using OBS do **NOT** use the Local File checkbox)

> For sizing try 225 for the height. 500 is a good starting off point for width
